      <h2>This page is all about Terri's pet Lu!</h2>
        <p>She is a color point siamese. Terri adopted her about three years ago. She was already five years old, so that makes her eight now! She does not like other cats, but she is Terri's <strong>best friend</strong>.  They do <em>almost</em> everything together.</p>

        <h2>These are some of her favorite toys</h2>
